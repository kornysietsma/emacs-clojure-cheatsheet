Emacs Clojure Cheat Sheet

This is my personal cheat sheet - it's mainly focused on what I find myself looking up over and over, so there are common things not included (like loading/saving files) if I find them easy to remember

Feel free to copy/clone/steal.  It's build in OmniGraffle, so not much use if you don't have that - one day I might port it to something else.

Assumes:

* Emacs 24+
* Clojure 1.4+
* starter-kit bits for clojure dev
* nrepl
* paredit
* projectile for project management
* *no* midje-mode - it seems to fight with projectile, and I don't find it adds much to my workflow
